## Theory and Approach
#### This project began with a powerful language model known as Llama 2 13b. To make it even more effective, it was fine-tuned on a specific dataset.  Additionally, RLHF was implemented using GPT2 as a reward model, further enhancing its capabilities for data conversion tasks.
